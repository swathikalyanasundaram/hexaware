## Ticket Booking System 
### Tasks 1: Database Design: 

1. Create the database named "TicketBookingSystem"      
    ```SQL
    create database TicketBookingsys;
    ```
2. Write SQL scripts to create the mentioned tables with appropriate data types, constraints, and 
relationships.  
• Venu  
• Event  
• Customers  
• Booking 

-  venue table

    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Venue (
    venue_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    venue_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    address VARCHAR(200) NOT NULL);
    ```

- event table
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Event (
    event_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    event_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    event_date DATE NOT NULL,
    event_time TIME NOT NULL,
    venue_id INT NOT NULL,
    total_seats INT NOT NULL,
    available_seats INT NOT NULL,
    ticket_price DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    event_type VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL CHECK (event_type IN ('Movie', 'Sports', 'Concert')),
    FOREIGN KEY (venue_id) REFERENCES Venue(venue_id));
    ```
- customers table
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Customer (
    customer_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    email VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    phone_number VARCHAR(20) NOT NULL);
    ```
- booking table
    ```sql
    CREATE TABLE Booking (
    booking_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
    customer_id INT NOT NULL,
    event_id INT NOT NULL,
    num_tickets INT NOT NULL,
    total_cost DECIMAL(10, 2) NOT NULL,
    booking_date DATE NOT NULL,
    FOREIGN KEY (customer_id) REFERENCES Customer(customer_id),
    FOREIGN KEY (event_id) REFERENCES Event(event_id));
    ```
